# Infinite 2D Chunk World - Procedurally Generated Terrain Exploration

This project demonstrates an implementation of an infinite 2D chunk world using Perlin noise for terrain generation. It allows for exploration and navigation within the world.

## Overview

The project utilizes HTML5 canvas and JavaScript to create a dynamic and interactive environment. Key features include:

* Procedural terrain generation using Perlin noise
* Dynamic chunk loading and unloading based on player position
* Smooth camera movement and navigation
* User interface for controlling camera speed and resetting position

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NIR3X/Infinite-2D-Chunk-World
cd Infinite-2D-Chunk-World
```

## Usage

* Use the mouse to navigate within the world.
* Press keys Q/W to increase/decrease camera speed.
* Press key R to reset the camera position.
* Explore the dynamically generated terrain.
